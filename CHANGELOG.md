# Changelog

Every release lists what changed for administrators, users and developers. A breaking change to
`/api/v1` (a removed or renamed route, a removed response status or field, a newly required request
field, a changed type) is named under `### Breaking` in the `[Unreleased]` section in the same change
that makes it; the release gate's contract step refuses a release that breaks the API silently.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Attome v2: one `attome` binary (`attome init`, `attome serve` and the operator commands) on
  PostgreSQL alone for a single server; Redis is optional.
- The release gate (`attome-release --check`, also `attome release --check`) writes a per-OS report
  to `target/release-gate/` and checks the API contract against the previous release.

### Breaking
- v2 renames every table, entity and API path segment that carried v1's `xrm_` or `core_` prefix
  (`/api/v1/xrm_service_ticket` is `/api/v1/service_ticket`); see `docs/roadmap-paths.md`.
- Licences are gone: `/api/v1/admin/system-health` reports `modules` instead of `license`.
